        <ul class="rule">
            <li><b>Players:</b> Two players take turns. One player uses X, and the other uses O.</li>
            <li><b>Starting the Game:</b> One player is chosen to go first.</li>
            <li><b>Making a Move:</b> On each turn, a player marks one of the empty squares with their symbol (X or O).</li>
            <li><b>Winning the Game:</b> The first player to get three of of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
            <li><b>Ending in a Draw:</b> If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw (also known as a tie or stalemate).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <ul class="rule">
            <li><b>No Overwriting:</b> Once a player places their symbol in a square, it cannot be changed or moved.</li>
            <li><b>Turns Alternate:</b> Players alternate turns. If player X goes first, player O will go next, and so on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <ul class="rule">
            <li><b>Forking:</b> Create opportunities where you have two ways to win on your next move.</li>
            <li><b>Blocking:</b> Always check if your opponent is about to win on their next move and block them if possible.</li>
            <li><b>Center:</b> Controlling the center square can give you more opportunities to create a row of three.</li>
        </ul>
